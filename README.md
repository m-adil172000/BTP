This study delves into boundary layer analysis in Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection (RBC), initially exploring thresholding as a segmentation method. However, it was found inadequate, particularly at higher Rayleigh numbers. Subsequently, the U-Net algorithm was employed to address this limitation and enhance image segmentation accuracy. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset for training and testing, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of U-Net in accurately capturing the intricate structures of boundary layers, overcoming the challenges posed by high Rayleigh numbers. These findings provide crucial insights into boundary layer behaviour in RBC, fostering a deeper understanding of heat transfer mechanisms and fluid flow dynamics in this fundamental yet complex phenomenon.
